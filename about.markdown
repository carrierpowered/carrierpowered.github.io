Say hello to CarrierPowered, the new toolbox made for Elite: Dangerous 
players and squadrons.

CarrierPowered is mainly oriented into background simulation. Its main goal 
is to ease the management of in-game player factions through automated 
strategies and fleet management tools.

CarrierPowered is a combination of several parts:

* The **Databank** holds temporal data about systems, factions, and presences.
* The **Strategy Manager** manages and controls strategies.
* The **Client Tool** collects logs from players and inform them of the 
  current strategies within a system.

This project was initiated and is currently ran by _CMDR Axelandre_, a 
member of the _EWSU_.
