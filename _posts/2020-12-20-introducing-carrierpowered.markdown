Say hello to CarrierPowered, the new toolbox made for Elite: Dangerous players.

CarrierPowered provides different tools based on _Databank_. _Databank_ is the main place for data storage. It 
stores market values, market history, player logs and much more.

The recommended client tool to update player logs is _Companion_. _Companion_ is an easy-to-setup tool that 
retrieves player logs from the game files.
